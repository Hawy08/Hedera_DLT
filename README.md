# Hedera_DLT

This project is a submission to the Hedera Hackathon, competing in the Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) category. Our solution leverages the unique capabilities of the Hedera network to address a pressing challenge in [mention the specific domain, e.g., supply chain management, carbon credit tracking, secure data sharing, etc.].
The core of our project is a decentralized application (dApp) that utilizes Hedera's services, including the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), Hedera Token Service (HTS), and/or Hedera Smart Contracts, to create a system.
